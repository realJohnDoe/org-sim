# Progress: Organizational Simulation

## Current Status
The project has progressed with the integration of UI controls, visualization enhancements, and the initial implementation of agent behavior for organizational structures. A dynamic slider for adjusting organizational size (5 to 50 nodes) and another for the number of direct reports per manager (2 to 5) have been added to `App.tsx`. The visualization in `src/simulation/visualization.tsx` has been updated to render edges correctly in dark grey with increased visibility and to ensure all nodes are visible through dynamic zoom and translation. The first version of the 'act' or 'release' action has been implemented in `src/simulation/agent.ts`, ensuring `submitProductGraph` returns 0 if not all product nodes meet or exceed demand node values, following TDD principles.

## What Works
- **Documentation Foundation**: The following Memory Bank files have been successfully created and populated with initial content:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Outlines project overview, requirements, goals, scope, and development approach.
  - `productContext.md`: Defines the purpose, problems addressed, functionality, user experience goals, and target audience.
  - `activeContext.md`: Captures current work focus, recent changes, next steps, decisions, patterns, and early learnings.
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Details the functional and declarative architecture, technical decisions, design patterns, and implementation paths.
  - `techContext.md`: Lists technologies, setup, constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.
  - Learning log summary `2025-07-summary-1.md` consolidates key learnings for July 1 and 2, 2025, by topic in `memory-bank/learning-log/`.
- **Project Initialization**: Vite project with React and TypeScript is set up at the repository root with necessary dependencies installed.
- **Testing Setup**: Jest is configured for TypeScript with a test script added to package.json, ready for TDD cycles.
- **Visualization Integration**: The `OrganizationGraph` component is integrated into `App.tsx`, rendering a force-directed graph of organizational structures using D3.js, with sliders to adjust the number of nodes and direct reports per manager dynamically.
- **Hierarchy Initialization**: Simplified edge generation logic in `src/simulation/state.ts` to create a balanced organizational hierarchy based on a specified number of direct reports per manager.
- **Test Updates**: Updated test logic in `src/simulation/state.test.ts` to correctly identify deeper hierarchy levels by checking for nodes not directly reporting to the root manager, with all tests passing.
- **Visualization Enhancements**: Updated `src/simulation/visualization.tsx` to render edges in dark grey with increased stroke width, corrected edge positioning using D3 simulation data, and implemented dynamic zoom to ensure all nodes are visible.
- **Agent Behavior Implementation**: Implemented the first version of the 'act' or 'release' action in `src/simulation/agent.ts` with `submitProductGraph`, which returns 0 if structures don't match or if any product node's value is less than its demand counterpart, verified by tests in `src/simulation/agent.test.ts`.
- **Tree Structure Refactoring**: Refactored tree representation to use a recursive `TreeNode` type in `src/simulation/supplyDemandProductTypes.ts`, ensuring proper connectivity through typing, with corresponding updates in `src/simulation/agent.ts` and `src/simulation/agent.test.ts`.

## What's Left to Build
- Add releases of the agents to the visualization.
- **Core Simulation Logic**: Implement pure functions with integrated testing for each increment following Test-Driven Development (TDD):
  - Agent behavior (Contributing, Request contributions) as declarative state transformations, with tests written before each behavior implementation.
  - Goal dynamics with configurable change frequencies, tested for correct state updates on change triggers.
  - Simulation engine to manage time steps and state transitions, with tests ensuring correct progression and state handling.
- **Performance Metrics**: Create functions to calculate and compare metrics (time to goal, efficiency, delegation frequency, rejection rates) for traditional vs. agile organizations under varying conditions (goal dimensionality 2-10, change frequency), with tests validating metric accuracy.
- **Deployment**: The application has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages using the workflow at `github/workflows/pages.yml`, tested for public access.
- Review the dependencies and remove unnecessary ones.

## Known Issues
- A warning was noted during dependency installation about an unsupported engine for Vite (required Node.js version ^20.19.0 or >=22.12.0, current version v22.11.0). This has not caused immediate issues but may need to be addressed if compatibility problems arise.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Plan**: Established a comprehensive plan in PLAN MODE, focusing on TypeScript, React, and D3.js for a web-based simulation with interactive visualization.
- **User Feedback on Architecture**: Shifted from object-oriented patterns to a functional and declarative approach based on user preference for system design.
- **State Management**: Decided against using specific libraries for immutability (e.g., Immer), opting to treat it as a best practice in coding standards.
- **Documentation Priority**: User emphasized setting up the Memory Bank first, ensuring all context is captured before coding begins, aligning with guidelines for memory reset continuity.
- **Testing Integration**: User requested testing be integrated into each feature development step rather than as a separate work package, aligning with TDD principles.
- **Project Location**: User moved the Vite project content to the repository root to simplify structure, which was accounted for during dependency installation.
- **Hierarchy Definition**: Updated test logic to reflect the user's definition of hierarchy levels, ensuring accurate validation of organizational structure.
- **Visualization Adjustments**: User feedback led to multiple iterations on visualization to ensure edge visibility and proper zoom levels for viewing all nodes.
