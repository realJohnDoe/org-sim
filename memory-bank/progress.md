# Progress: Organizational Simulation

## Current Status
The project is in the initial setup phase. All core Memory Bank documentation files have been created to establish the project's context, architecture, and development guidelines. No functional code or simulation logic has been implemented yet.

## What Works
- **Documentation Foundation**: The following Memory Bank files have been successfully created and populated with initial content:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Outlines project overview, requirements, goals, scope, and development approach.
  - `productContext.md`: Defines the purpose, problems addressed, functionality, user experience goals, and target audience.
  - `activeContext.md`: Captures current work focus, recent changes, next steps, decisions, patterns, and early learnings.
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Details the functional and declarative architecture, technical decisions, design patterns, and implementation paths.
  - `techContext.md`: Lists technologies, setup, constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.

## What's Left to Build
- **Project Initialization**: Set up a TypeScript project using Vite, configured for React and deployment to GitHub Pages.
- **Core Simulation Logic**: Implement pure functions with integrated testing for each increment following Test-Driven Development (TDD):
  - Organizational state management (n-dimensional vectors and graph structures for traditional and agile setups), starting with a failing test for state initialization, then implementing minimal logic to pass.
  - Agent behavior (idea generation, act, delegate, break down, reject) as declarative state transformations, with tests written before each behavior implementation.
  - Goal dynamics with configurable change frequencies, tested for correct state updates on change triggers.
  - Simulation engine to manage time steps and state transitions, with tests ensuring correct progression and state handling.
- **Visualization Layer**: Develop React components and D3.js visualizations to render organizational graphs and project multi-dimensional movement for user interaction, with tests for rendering correctness and parameter updates.
- **Performance Metrics**: Create functions to calculate and compare metrics (time to goal, efficiency, delegation frequency, rejection rates) for traditional vs. agile organizations under varying conditions (goal dimensionality 2-10, change frequency), with tests validating metric accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Configure and deploy the application to GitHub Pages for public access, ensuring deployment scripts are tested for successful builds.

## Known Issues
- No issues identified at this stage as development of functional components has not yet begun.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Plan**: Established a comprehensive plan in PLAN MODE, focusing on TypeScript, React, and D3.js for a web-based simulation with interactive visualization.
- **User Feedback on Architecture**: Shifted from object-oriented patterns to a functional and declarative approach based on user preference for system design.
- **State Management**: Decided against using specific libraries for immutability (e.g., Immer), opting to treat it as a best practice in coding standards.
- **Documentation Priority**: User emphasized setting up the Memory Bank first, ensuring all context is captured before coding begins, aligning with guidelines for memory reset continuity.
- **Testing Integration**: User requested testing be integrated into each feature development step rather than as a separate work package, aligning with TDD principles.

## Next Immediate Steps (Following TDD and Tidy First)
1. Initialize the Vite project with React and TypeScript, setting up the basic structure and dependencies (meta change).
2. Write the first failing test for organizational state initialization (behavioral change).
3. Implement minimal logic to pass the test, focusing on immutable data structures (behavioral change).
4. Refactor if necessary, separating structural changes from behavioral ones in commits.
5. Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` with each increment to reflect new functionality and next tasks.
