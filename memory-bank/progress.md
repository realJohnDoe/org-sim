# Progress: Organizational Simulation

## Current Status
The project has completed the initial setup phase. The TypeScript project using Vite for React has been initialized at the root of the repository, and necessary dependencies for visualization (D3.js) and testing (Jest, @testing-library/react) have been installed. Jest configuration and setup files have been created to enable Test-Driven Development (TDD). No functional simulation logic has been implemented yet.

## What Works
- **Documentation Foundation**: The following Memory Bank files have been successfully created and populated with initial content:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Outlines project overview, requirements, goals, scope, and development approach.
  - `productContext.md`: Defines the purpose, problems addressed, functionality, user experience goals, and target audience.
  - `activeContext.md`: Captures current work focus, recent changes, next steps, decisions, patterns, and early learnings.
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Details the functional and declarative architecture, technical decisions, design patterns, and implementation paths.
  - `techContext.md`: Lists technologies, setup, constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.
- **Project Initialization**: Vite project with React and TypeScript is set up at the repository root with necessary dependencies installed.
- **Testing Setup**: Jest is configured for TypeScript with a test script added to package.json, ready for TDD cycles.

## What's Left to Build
- Split agent definition from org definition
- **Core Simulation Logic**: Implement pure functions with integrated testing for each increment following Test-Driven Development (TDD):
  - Organizational state management (n-dimensional vectors and graph structures for traditional and agile setups), starting with a failing test for state initialization, then implementing minimal logic to pass.
  - Agent behavior (idea generation, act, delegate, break down, reject) as declarative state transformations, with tests written before each behavior implementation.
  - Goal dynamics with configurable change frequencies, tested for correct state updates on change triggers.
  - Simulation engine to manage time steps and state transitions, with tests ensuring correct progression and state handling.
- **Visualization Layer**: Develop React components and D3.js visualizations to render organizational graphs and project multi-dimensional movement for user interaction, with tests for rendering correctness and parameter updates.
- **Performance Metrics**: Create functions to calculate and compare metrics (time to goal, efficiency, delegation frequency, rejection rates) for traditional vs. agile organizations under varying conditions (goal dimensionality 2-10, change frequency), with tests validating metric accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Configure and deploy the application to GitHub Pages for public access, ensuring deployment scripts are tested for successful builds.
- Review the dependencies and remove unnecessary ones

## Known Issues
- A warning was noted during dependency installation about an unsupported engine for Vite (required Node.js version ^20.19.0 or >=22.12.0, current version v22.11.0). This has not caused immediate issues but may need to be addressed if compatibility problems arise.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Plan**: Established a comprehensive plan in PLAN MODE, focusing on TypeScript, React, and D3.js for a web-based simulation with interactive visualization.
- **User Feedback on Architecture**: Shifted from object-oriented patterns to a functional and declarative approach based on user preference for system design.
- **State Management**: Decided against using specific libraries for immutability (e.g., Immer), opting to treat it as a best practice in coding standards.
- **Documentation Priority**: User emphasized setting up the Memory Bank first, ensuring all context is captured before coding begins, aligning with guidelines for memory reset continuity.
- **Testing Integration**: User requested testing be integrated into each feature development step rather than as a separate work package, aligning with TDD principles.
- **Project Location**: User moved the Vite project content to the repository root to simplify structure, which was accounted for during dependency installation.

## Next Immediate Steps (Following TDD and Tidy First)
1. ~~Write the first failing test for organizational state initialization (behavioral change).~~ [Completed]
2. ~~Implement minimal logic to pass the test, focusing on immutable data structures (behavioral change).~~ [Completed]
3. Refactor if necessary, separating structural changes from behavioral ones in commits.
4. Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` with each increment to reflect new functionality and next tasks.
5. Write the next failing test for adding agents with capability vectors to the organizational state (behavioral change).
6. Implement minimal logic to pass the test for agent initialization (behavioral change).
