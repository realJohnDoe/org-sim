# Progress: Organizational Simulation

## Current Status
The project has progressed beyond initial setup, with the visualization of organizational structures integrated into the main application. A dynamic slider for adjusting organizational size (5 to 50 nodes) has been added to `App.tsx`. Core simulation logic and agent behaviors are yet to be implemented, following TDD principles.

## What Works
- **Documentation Foundation**: The following Memory Bank files have been successfully created and populated with initial content:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Outlines project overview, requirements, goals, scope, and development approach.
  - `productContext.md`: Defines the purpose, problems addressed, functionality, user experience goals, and target audience.
  - `activeContext.md`: Captures current work focus, recent changes, next steps, decisions, patterns, and early learnings.
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Details the functional and declarative architecture, technical decisions, design patterns, and implementation paths.
  - `techContext.md`: Lists technologies, setup, constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.
- **Project Initialization**: Vite project with React and TypeScript is set up at the repository root with necessary dependencies installed.
- **Testing Setup**: Jest is configured for TypeScript with a test script added to package.json, ready for TDD cycles.
- **Visualization Integration**: The `OrganizationGraph` component is integrated into `App.tsx`, rendering a force-directed graph of organizational structures using D3.js, with a slider to adjust the number of nodes dynamically.

## What's Left to Build
- Integrate another slider for the number of direct reports per manager
- Implement first version of acting: submitting a product graph to be checked against the demand graph
- Split agent definition from org definition
- Implement first version of acting: submitting a product graph to be checked against the demand graph.
- Split agent definition from org definition.
- **Core Simulation Logic**: Implement pure functions with integrated testing for each increment following Test-Driven Development (TDD):
  - Agent behavior (idea generation, act, delegate, break down, reject) as declarative state transformations, with tests written before each behavior implementation.
  - Goal dynamics with configurable change frequencies, tested for correct state updates on change triggers.
  - Simulation engine to manage time steps and state transitions, with tests ensuring correct progression and state handling.
- **Performance Metrics**: Create functions to calculate and compare metrics (time to goal, efficiency, delegation frequency, rejection rates) for traditional vs. agile organizations under varying conditions (goal dimensionality 2-10, change frequency), with tests validating metric accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Configure and deploy the application to GitHub Pages for public access, ensuring deployment scripts are tested for successful builds.
- Review the dependencies and remove unnecessary ones.

## Known Issues
- A warning was noted during dependency installation about an unsupported engine for Vite (required Node.js version ^20.19.0 or >=22.12.0, current version v22.11.0). This has not caused immediate issues but may need to be addressed if compatibility problems arise.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Plan**: Established a comprehensive plan in PLAN MODE, focusing on TypeScript, React, and D3.js for a web-based simulation with interactive visualization.
- **User Feedback on Architecture**: Shifted from object-oriented patterns to a functional and declarative approach based on user preference for system design.
- **State Management**: Decided against using specific libraries for immutability (e.g., Immer), opting to treat it as a best practice in coding standards.
- **Documentation Priority**: User emphasized setting up the Memory Bank first, ensuring all context is captured before coding begins, aligning with guidelines for memory reset continuity.
- **Testing Integration**: User requested testing be integrated into each feature development step rather than as a separate work package, aligning with TDD principles.
- **Project Location**: User moved the Vite project content to the repository root to simplify structure, which was accounted for during dependency installation.
