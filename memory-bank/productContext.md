# Product Context: Organizational Simulation

## Purpose
This project exists to simulate and analyze the dynamics of different organizational structures when pursuing goals in a multi-dimensional space. It aims to provide insights into how traditional hierarchical organizations and agile organizations with cross-functional teams respond to varying goal conditions, specifically in terms of dimensionality and change frequency.

## Problems Addressed
- **Understanding Organizational Efficiency**: How do different structures impact the speed and effectiveness of reaching goals?
- **Goal Adaptability**: How well can organizations adapt to frequently changing goals or goals of higher complexity (dimensionality)?
- **Agent Interaction Dynamics**: How do agent behaviors (idea generation, action, delegation, decomposition, rejection) influence overall organizational movement towards goals?

## Intended Functionality
- **Simulation of Structures**: Model traditional (deep hierarchy) and agile (flatter, cross-functional) organizations as graphs and vectors in n-dimensional space.
- **Goal Pursuit**: Simulate movement towards target positions (goals) that can change over time, testing adaptability.
- **Agent Behavior Modeling**: Implement realistic agent decision-making processes including acting on ideas, delegating tasks, breaking down complex ideas, or rejecting unsuitable ones.
- **Performance Analysis**: Generate comparative data on how different organizational types perform under specified conditions (goal dimensionality 2-10, change frequency variations).
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provide a web-based interface to visualize organizational structures, agent interactions, and movement in space, allowing users to adjust parameters for experimentation.

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity**: Users should easily understand the simulation's purpose and the visualized results through intuitive graphs and metrics.
- **Interactivity**: Enable users to modify simulation parameters (e.g., organization size 5-100, goal dimensions, change frequency) to explore different scenarios.
- **Accessibility**: Deploy the simulation on GitHub Pages for easy access via web browsers without additional setup.
- **Educational Value**: Offer insights into organizational theory and dynamics through actionable, visual data, supporting hypotheses like agile organizations performing better under frequent goal changes and higher dimensionality.

## Target Audience
- Researchers and students in organizational theory and management science.
- Business leaders and consultants interested in structural impacts on performance.
- Software developers and data scientists exploring simulation and visualization techniques.
