## Topic: Hierarchy Initialization and Test Logic Alignment

## Insights:
- **Simplifying Algorithms**: Simplifying the edge generation logic for organizational hierarchy in `src/simulation/state.ts` from a complex dynamic manager selection to a sequential assignment with a direct report limit significantly reduced code complexity while maintaining the required functionality. This approach ensures a balanced hierarchy structure with less overhead in tracking available managers.
- **Test Logic Alignment**: User feedback was crucial in identifying a mismatch between the test's definition of hierarchy levels and the intended structure. Updating the test `should create third hierarchy level for size 7 and 2 direct reports` in `src/simulation/state.test.ts` to check for nodes not directly reporting to the root manager aligned the validation with the project's conceptual understanding of hierarchy depth.
- **TDD Cycle Importance**: Following the TDD cycle (Red -> Green -> Refactor) was essential in iterating on the hierarchy initialization logic. Multiple iterations were needed to pass the test, highlighting the importance of writing failing tests first to guide implementation, then refining the code to meet requirements.
- **User Collaboration**: Engaging with user feedback during development helped clarify misunderstandings about hierarchy levels, reinforcing the need for clear communication and iterative validation in software development, especially when dealing with abstract concepts like organizational structures.

## Challenges:
- **Test Failure Interpretation**: Initial attempts to simplify the initialization algorithm led to repeated test failures for `should create third hierarchy level for size 7 and 2 direct reports`. Interpreting the test logic and edge outputs required multiple iterations to understand that the test's definition of a third level was not being met by the generated hierarchy.
- **Balancing Simplicity and Functionality**: Striking a balance between a simplified algorithm and meeting the test requirements for hierarchy depth was challenging. Early simplified versions did not create the expected deeper levels, necessitating adjustments to ensure the structure matched user expectations.

## Next Steps:
- Continue applying TDD principles to upcoming features, such as integrating a slider for direct reports per manager and implementing agent behavior logic, ensuring tests guide development.
- Document further learnings from user interactions to refine conceptual definitions (like hierarchy levels) in future iterations, enhancing alignment between code, tests, and project goals.
