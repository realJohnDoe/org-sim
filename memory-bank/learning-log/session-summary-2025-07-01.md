# Session Summary - 2025-07-01

## Overview
This chat session focused on setting up the Organizational Simulation project, adhering to Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Tidy First principles. The session involved project initialization, resolving testing setup issues, and updating the Memory Bank documentation.

## Key Activities
- **Project Initialization**: Set up a TypeScript project using Vite for React, installed dependencies including D3.js for visualization and Jest for testing.
- **Jest Configuration**: Resolved issues with ES module scope by renaming configuration files to '.cjs' and confirmed the installation of 'jest-environment-jsdom' for the test environment.
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Reviewed and updated all core Memory Bank files ('projectbrief.md', 'productContext.md', 'systemPatterns.md', 'techContext.md', 'activeContext.md', 'progress.md') to ensure documentation reflects the current project state.
- **TDD Preparation**: Attempted to write the first failing test for organizational state initialization, though this was interrupted.

## Issues Encountered
- Initial errors with Jest setup due to ES module scope conflicts, resolved by renaming configuration files.
- A warning about an unsupported Vite engine version was noted but did not impede progress.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with writing the first failing test for organizational state initialization.
- Implement minimal logic to pass the test, focusing on immutable data structures.
- Continue following TDD cycles with separate commits for structural and behavioral changes.

## Learnings
- Importance of module system compatibility in modern JavaScript projects, especially with tools like Jest in ES module environments.
- Necessity of thorough documentation updates to maintain project continuity across sessions.
