## Topic: GitHub Actions Workflow for GitHub Pages Deployment

- **Insight**: The initial GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` encountered permission issues during deployment to GitHub Pages. The user successfully used an alternative workflow file located at `github/workflows/pages.yml`, which worked correctly and was tested on mobile devices.
- **Lesson**: Ensure that the correct workflow file path is referenced and that permissions are properly configured in GitHub Actions for deployment tasks. Using the `permissions` block with `contents: write` can help, but verifying the repository settings for GitHub Pages access is also crucial.
- **Application**: Updated Memory Bank documentation to reference the correct workflow path and noted the importance of testing deployment configurations across different environments, including mobile devices.
