# Learning Log Entry: Agent Model Updates (2025-07-02-01)

## Summary
During this session, the Memory Bank documentation was updated to reflect a refined understanding of agent models in the Organizational Simulation project. Key updates include:

- **Agent Capabilities**: Modeled as supply trees, representing immutable hierarchical structures of capabilities.
- **Agent Demand Models**: Represented as trees capturing the agent's understanding of tasks or goals, defined as mutable data that can be updated with new context from peers.
- **Agent Actions**: Defined as submitting product trees, which are shallow subsets of supply trees and subsets of demand models, with rewards based on alignment with the real (secret) demand model.
- **Three Primary Actions**: Documented as requesting context, sharing context, and acting (submitting a product graph to be checked against the demand graph).

These updates ensure that the conceptual framework for agent behavior and interaction is clearly captured in the Memory Bank for future reference and continuity after memory resets.

## Insights
- Clarifying the mutability of demand models highlights the dynamic nature of agent understanding, which evolves through interaction and context sharing.
- The reward mechanism based on alignment with a secret demand model introduces an interesting challenge for simulation logic, focusing on approximation and learning.

## Next Steps
- Consider how the mutability of demand models impacts simulation logic and state transformations in upcoming TDD cycles.
