# Learning Log Summary: July 2025 (Version 1)

## Overview
This summary consolidates key learnings from the Organizational Simulation project for July 1 and July 2, 2025, organized by topic as requested.

## Key Learnings by Topic

1. **Project Setup and Configuration**:
   - Setting up the project with Vite for React and TypeScript required resolving Jest configuration issues with ES module scope by renaming files to '.cjs' and ensuring dependencies like 'jest-environment-jsdom'.
   - Module system compatibility is critical for integrating testing tools like Jest.
   - Additional Jest and TypeScript configuration challenges were addressed using 'ts-jest' for transformation and '@swc/jest' for ESM compatibility with D3.js via 'transformIgnorePatterns'.

2. **Development Practices (TDD, Documentation, and Tidy First)**:
   - Completed the first TDD cycle with a failing test for state initialization, implementing minimal logic to pass, reinforced by user feedback to refine specifications.
   - TDD cycles were vital for iterating on hierarchy logic to meet test requirements.
   - Thorough Memory Bank updates were emphasized for project continuity across sessions.
   - Adhered to Tidy First by separating structural and behavioral changes for clarity in development and commit history.

3. **Agent Model and Simulation Logic**:
   - Updated Memory Bank to define agent supply trees (immutable capabilities), mutable demand models, and actions like submitting product trees for evaluation against a secret demand model.
   - Demand model mutability was noted as key for dynamic agent learning through interaction.

4. **Hierarchy Initialization and Logic**:
   - Simplified hierarchy edge generation with sequential assignment and direct report limits to reduce complexity while maintaining functionality.
   - User feedback aligned test logic with conceptual hierarchy level understanding.

5. **Visualization and UI Integration**:
   - Integrated 'OrganizationGraph' with D3.js for force-directed graph visualization, adding a slider for organizational size (5-100 nodes) for real-time interaction.
   - Added UI sliders for parameters like direct reports, linked to state for dynamic updates.
   - UI controls enhanced engagement, balancing clarity and performance with parameter limits.
   - Fixed visualization issues like invisible edges with simulation position references and nodes outside viewable area via bounding box calculations for zoom.
   - User feedback drove iterations to refine visualization styling and rendering.
   - D3.js type mismatches needed assertions; testing visual components required SVG setup.

## Conclusion
These topics encapsulate the core learnings from the project so far, covering setup, development methodology, conceptual modeling, and user interaction aspects.
